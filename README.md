## tarkov-stash-console

Simple profile editor to increase and change various items from your stash.

It is recommended to run this with [Windows terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701) and not the default command prompt, you can drop your profile file into the terminal window and it supports emojis :-)

Never run any `.exe` file that you have downloaded from internet. Including this. Use it at your own risk.
